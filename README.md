## What is Sketch Markup Listify?

A Sketch 3 plugin built to make the life of every designer and front-end developer a little bit easier. The idea behind this plugin is to make it fast and easy to convert and copy your text layers or groups with text layers into HTML lists. 

## How will it help?

Using Sketch Markup Listify plugin you can speed up your HTML coding process when you need to include in your code large lists or option elements from Sketch.

## How to use it?

To get your markup list pasteable, please select text layers, groups of layers (with text layers) or both, and then go to `Plugins ▸ Markup Listify`, or just press the keyboard shortcut `cmd + ⌥ + l`, and voilá. But nothing speaks better than an image:

## Roadmap & Feature Ideas

* [ ] Build relations between text layers and its sub-groups.
* [ ] Create an option to select the type of list tags, like, `ul`, `ol` or `option`.
* [ ] Create an option to select the tags that might need to be inserted inside `li` tags, like, for example, `li > a`, `li > p`, `li > span`, etc.
* [ ] Find a solution for handling invisible layers or group of layers.
* [ ] Create an option to copy Pug (old Jade), Markdown and Handlebars.
* [ ] Create an option to copy the JSON corresponding to the selection made.
* [ ] Consider the possibility of creating pasteable markup lists with images, text and shapes.
* [ ] Consider the possibility of developing the inverse action, i.e., have an HTML list and be able to convert it into groups and/or text layers.
